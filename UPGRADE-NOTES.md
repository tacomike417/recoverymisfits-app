# Recovery Misfits — Upgrade Notes

One list for this project. New ideas and decisions go here.

## The social feed (idea — waiting on votes)

Preview is live at /feed/ (made-up people). Votes land in the `feed_votes`
table in the Recovery Misfits Supabase project. Read them with
`supabase/feed_votes_results.sql`.

Nothing below gets built until the votes are in and it's decided.

### Sign-up: the split way (decided 29 Sep 2026)
- **Using the app stays anonymous.** Readings, coins, the Survival Pile,
  Nightly Inventory: no email, no phone, nothing. The morning is the front
  door and it never gets a lock.
- **Posting needs a confirmed email.** Posting, commenting and messaging only.
  It gives reports and bans something to stick to, so a troll can't just make
  a new account every five minutes. A throwaway email is fine.
- **No phone numbers.** They cost money per text, add friction, and feel like a
  real name to people protecting their anonymity.

### Already promised in the preview's safety list
- Anonymity: people in a photo need the poster's OK (the poster's responsibility,
  no automatic blur); no real names needed; sober date shows only if you want.
- No ego stuff: no likes, follower counts, streaks or day counts next to names.
  Just "Proud of you" and "Me too."
- Keeping it kind: report button on every post and comment, block anyone,
  cussing and slurs stopped before posting, links checked for scams and adult
  stuff, account paused after enough reports until a real person looks.
- Who gets in: 18 and up, confirmed email, brand-new accounts wait a few days
  before posting, private messages only between people who follow each other.
- Your stuff: delete a post or your whole account any time; help lines one tap
  away on every screen.

### Shape
- The morning reading stays the front page, always. The feed lives on its own
  spot on the rail: INVITE · FEED · MY PILE · MY COINS · TODAY.
- A recovery app, not an AA app. Anyone on any path is welcome. The feel is
  about 75% AA, 25% other paths.
- "New Misfits · say hi" row of faces and names only, with no counts.
- The open question: does a feed pull people away from the quiet morning part?

## Install
- 29 Sep 2026: the Install button installs our own app (the PWA), not Google
  Play. Moving away from Google Play.
